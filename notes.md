I want to turn this directory into a webapp, which I will host at ht.hccs.dev. "ht" stands for Holland Tunnel, the app is a visualization / presentation of a concept I've been working on, about a system where one of the two lanes (each way) of the Holland Tunnel can be used as a bike lane, for 10 minutes of every hour. I want an animation that simulates an hour of time (sped up, on a loop), where cars are using both lanes as normal for 45mins of the hour, while bikes queue up near the entrance. Then at the :45, one lane is closed to cars, and bikes are allowed to enter for 3m, until :48. No one enters the lane for 2m, then at :50 a "sweep" van leaves, aiming to take 10m to cross, picking up any stragglers/bikes. At :55, "pace car" leaves, and the waiting traffic follows it, converting the lane back to cars. Ideally the pace car won't catch the sweep. The sweep van and pace car can then drive back the other direction, where the same sequence occurs, offset by 30m within each hour.

To show people how this can work, I want the webapp to show the tunnel (both directions), with cars moving through (they can be little emojis to start, or maybe there's fa-icons or more something more elaborate. There should be a clock showing where in the hour we are, bikes queueing, and then the steps above playing out.

I usually make static webapps with React, TS, pnpm, and Vite. I've struggled to learn a few react animation libraries I've tried. If React isn't a good fit and something else should be used (d3? or anything), I'm open to that. If React should be sufficient, that's fine too. Ultimately I'd like this to be embeddable in a page, like a React component, with other JS/CSS/HTML, explaining different aspects and motivations for the plan (e.g. there's no way for bikes or peds to cross the Hudson right now). What tools should we use for this, what else should I consider?
